Hi!

here is the small set of files with the code and the needed library to run the histogram app called<br>
<b>"Higgs to WW - simulated data"</b> in</br>
http://opendata.atlas.cern/visualisations/analyser-js.php

The two files that you can explore, are crossfilter.html and outreach.csv
Where the crossfilter.html is (mainly) the one to study and hack :)

for feedback, please use one of our channels in:<br>
